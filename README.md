# MultivariateRegression

Crime

The data (X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7) are for each city.

X1 = total overall reported crime rate per 1 million residents

X2 = reported violent crime rate per 100,000 residents

X3 = annual police funding in $/resident

X4 = % of people 25 years+ with 4 yrs. of high school

X5 = % of 16 to 19 year-olds not in highschool and not highschool graduates

X6 = % of 18 to 24 year-olds in college

X7 = % of people 25 years+ with at least 4 years of college

The data is obtained from the below given website:

I have taken X1 as a target variable and x3,x4,x5,x6 and x7 as independent variable.
The data looks something like this:

After running the multivariate regression model the out looks like the one given below:

Seeing the p value we can infer that the total reported crime depends on annual police funding.
